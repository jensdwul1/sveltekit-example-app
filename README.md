# An Example app in Sveltekit

This app will be a small scale reproduction of an existing application (Spravato Navigator). The basic goal will be to reproduce as much of the core functionality in a small amount of time

## Target Features

- [ ] Data Collection
- [ ] Dashboard
- [ ] Report Generation


## Install

Install dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`)

## Development

Start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
